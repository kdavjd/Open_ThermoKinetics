# Open ThermoKinetics

## Introduction
**Open ThermoKinetics** is an open-source toolkit for the *isoconversional* study of solid-phase reaction kinetics. It allows you to analyze thermal analysis data (e.g., from Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) or Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)) and determine key kinetic parameters of reactions under non-isothermal conditions. Using Open ThermoKinetics, researchers can obtain the full kinetic *“triplet”* — activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and reaction model — for each reaction stage by applying various well-established methods. The project implements all common used methods, providing a free alternative to proprietary thermokinetic software for reliable kinetic analysis.
